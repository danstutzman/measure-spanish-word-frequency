GOAL: look for words and constructions that are both:
 - super frequent in spoken language
 - hard for spanish learners

#Numbers are off because not normalized to 1M in denominator?
3K+, top 50 = invisible
1-3K, top 140 = pretty much known spanish words
300-1000, top 300 -> easy to recognize, might have to think to produce
150-300, top 600 -> getting a little "spanishy"

"basic english" = top 850 or 1000

JLPT N5 has 800 words but only 100 kanji
JLPT N4 has 1500 words and 300 kanji!
Old JLPT1 -> new N1
Old JLPT2 -> new N2 and N3
Old JLPT3 -> new N4
Old JLPT4 -> new N5

Susie Dent says:
20,000 = the average active vocabulary of an adult English speaker
40,000 = passive

1,000 English words gives 89% coverage
3,000 English words gives 95% coverage
600 French words gives 90% coverage

Alexander Arguelles (a guy who has devoted his life to language learning): 
- 250 words constitute the essential core of a language, those without which you cannot construct any sentence.
- 750 words constitute those that are used every single day by every person who speaks the language.
- 2500 words constitute those that should enable you to express everything you could possibly want to say, albeit often by awkward circumlocutions.
- 5000 words constitute the active vocabulary of native speakers without higher education.
- 10,000 words constitute the active vocabulary of native speakers with higher education.
- 20,000 words constitute what you need to recognize passively in order to read, understand, and enjoy a work of literature such as a novel by a notable author.

Russian:

200 50%
524 60%

Learning the first 1000 most frequently used words in the entire language will allow you to understand 76.0% of all non-fiction writing, 79.6% of all fiction writing, and an astounding 87.8% of all oral speech.
Learning the top 2000 most frequently used words will get you to 84% for non-fiction, 86.1% for fiction, and 92.7% for oral speech.
And learning the top 3000 most frequently used words will get you to 88.2% for non-fiction, 89.6% for fiction, and 94.0% for oral speech.

Assume that a language learner is aiming for 90% coverage in each of the four parts of speech that represent open classes — nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. 
 This 90% figure will be obtained by knowing about 2600 nouns, 230 verbs, 980 adjectives, and 50 adverbs, or a total of about 3800 total forms

I gave her a two hour lesson in how to construct useful conversational phrases. Starting off with simple things like “I have to say that ..” and “Don’t be upset, but” and building up and chaining these things together into more complex sentences such as “That isn’t something I have given much thought to, but … now that I reflect on it, … my personal opinion is …”
